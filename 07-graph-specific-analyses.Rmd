Highlight

+ Early strains:
    + (Wuhan, 12/30/2019)
    + (Italy, 4/27/2020)
    
+ **Spike protein**
    + Engages the human ACE2 cell receptor to gain entry into the host cell. Target for vaccines, template for antibody production, and candidate for generating entry inhibitors.

### D614G mutation

A mutation seen in Europe in February that spread across the globe to become the dominant strain. Preliminary analyses suggest it might increase contagion and/or virulence and that strains people with immunity to the original strain might not be immune to the mutated strain. The figure shows the region has undergone genomic shift and isn‚Äôt conserved in all the genomes.

## Running FindFRs3

Let's look for frequented regions in the cuttlefish graphs. Note that FindFRs3 is a heuristic algorithm, which means that results can vary slightly from run to run. You're FR numbers might look a bit different than mine.

This version is more efficient and uses reduced-GFA format. It also will look for alternate paths in the same part of the graph.

We'll use the cuttlefish reduced-GFA graphs. Note that you need to use the same kmer size in FindFRs3 that you used in cuttlefish.

Go into your cuttlefish directory (if you aren't already there)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cd ~/cuttlefish
```

Let's get usage.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
/home/pangenomics/scripts/jdk-19.0.1/bin/java -Xmx26g -jar /home/pangenomics/scripts/FindFRs3.jar
```

Missing required options: n, p, b, a, k, m  
usage: FindFRs3  
 -a,--alpha <arg>    alpha parameter  
 -b,--bed <arg>      BED output file  
 -k,--kmer <arg>     k-mer size  
 -ka,--kappa <arg>   kappa parameter (default = 0)  
 -l,--minlen <arg>   min avg support length parameter (bp)  
 -m,--minsup <arg>   min support parameter  
 -n,--seg <arg>      GFA3 seg file  
 -p,--seq <arg>      GFA3 seq file  

Run FindFRs3 on the cuttlefish graph (~15min)

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
/home/pangenomics/scripts/jdk-19.0.1/bin/java -Xmx26g -jar /home/pangenomics/scripts/FindFRs3.jar -a 0.7 -k 63 -ka 10 -m 2 -l 100 -b 12genomes.k63.a70.ka10.m2.l100.bed -n 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seg -p 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seq
```

Take a look at the output files (note that yours might be a little different):  
BED file (connects fr nodes to input assemblies)  
fr nodes  
fr variant paths

```{bash,eval=FALSE}
head 12genomes.k63.a70.ka10.m2.l100.bed
head 12genomes.k63.a70.ka10.m2.l100.bed.frs
head 12genomes.k63.a70.ka10.m2.l100.bed.frv
```


How many segments are there in the cuttlefish GFA? [Hint: count the lines in 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seg]

How many frs are there? [Hint: count the lines in 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seq.bed.frs]

Haw many paths through those frs are there? [Hint: count the lines in 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seq.bed.frv]

## CUP1 region


![Structural Rearrangement](./Figures/StructuralRearrangements.png){width=100%}
 
Find the region in the graph based on its S288C coordinates  

Let's pull out S288C chrVIII and sort by position so we can look for the S288C path through the CUP1 region:  
S288C.chrVIII:213045-233214

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep S288C.chrVIII 12genomes.k63.a70.ka10.m2.l100.bed|sort -nk2
```

What are the flanking frs (reminder, yours might be different)?

Let's find the segments in the S288C paths for these flanking frs.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep -E "fr1608:0|fr1611:1" 12genomes.k63.a70.ka10.m2.l100.bed.frv
```

Now find the S288C segments that span the region between the flanking frs.

The cf_seq file has the full paths for each of the chromosomes. Let's look at S288C.chrVIII.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep S288C.chrVIII 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seq
```

Let's get each of the fields on their own line.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep S288C.chrVIII 12genomes.k63.f3.cf_seq | sed 's/\s\+/\n/g' > S288C.chrVIII.segs.txt
head S288C.chrVIII.segs.txt
```

Now grab all the segments in the S288C path between segments 8243883 and 30102060. You could do this manually by searching for one then scrolling to the other but let's work on our unix skills.

First, find which row each segment is on in the S288C.chrVIII.segs.txt file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
grep -n 8243883 S288C.chrVIII.segs.txt
grep -n 30102060 S288C.chrVIII.segs.txt
```

Now, we'll remove lines after those we want, then remove lines before those we want. We'll also remove the + and - signs at the end of each segment.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
head -6398 S288C.chrVIII.segs.txt | tail -n +5700 | sed 's/[+-]//' > S288C.segs.txt
```


We can use gfatools view to pull out the gfa for these segments. Before we fed in only one segment but you can also feed in a file of segments. Check out the usage to figure out how.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
gfatools view
```

Usage: gfatools view [options] <in.gfa>  
Options:  
  -v INT        verbose level [2]  
  -l STR/@FILE  segment list to subset []  
  -R STR        a region like chr1:101-200 (a 1-based closed region) []  
  -r INT        subset radius (effective with -l) [0]  
  -d            delete the list of segments (requiring -l; ignoring -r)  
  -M            remove multiple edges  
  -S            don't print sequences  


We'll pull the S288C segments out of the cuttlefish GFA1 file.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
gfatools view -l @S288C.segs.txt -r 0 12genomes.k63.f1.gfa1 > S288C.0.segs.gfa
```

View it in bandage and blast the CUP1 and YHR054C genes if you have blast installed.

Now let's expand the graph so that we capture some nearby paths from other yeast strains.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
gfatools view -l @S288C.segs.txt -r 10 12genomes.k63.f1.gfa1 > S288C.10.segs.gfa
```

View it in bandage and blast the CUP1 and YHR054C genes if you have blast installed.
