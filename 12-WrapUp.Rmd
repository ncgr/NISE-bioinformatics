## Questions

If you have **bioinformatics or technical questions**, please email inbre@ncgr.org, which will send emails to everyone on the inbre team. 

If you have questions on **passwords/password resets, payments, receipts, etc,** please email Ethan Price at eprice@ncgr.org and cc inbre@ncgr.org. 

Occasionally, we change servers or change how to log in so if you are having issues, please contact us.


## Server access and acknowledgements

For those of you who requested continued access to our server, we will extend your account for 1 year. If you need it longer, please email us and we'll be happy to work with you. We ask that you don't run really large jobs while we are running workshops to avoid slowing things down. So, if you have a really large job to run, please check in with us so we can let you know when workshops will be happening.

Please note, if you use our servers to do analysis that you publish, you need to acknowledge the National Center for Genome Resources (NCGR) and the INBRE grant in your acknowledgements. Instructions for the latter can be found here: https://nminbre.nmsu.edu/cite-us/cite-us.html. 

This is really important for our annual reports so thank you in advance!

Additionally, in order to share your publications in our annual reporting, and to comply with NIH guidelines for open access, please include a PMCID with your publication.  Instructions: [Include PMCID in Citations](https://publicaccess.nih.gov/include-pmcid-citations.htm).

## Zoom recordings
We will only record if someone has to miss a session. Please do not share the zoom recordings as we don't have permissions from everyone who participated. Feel free to use them for your own use. Links to zoom recordings can be found on the Discord channel.

The zoom recordings will be available for at least 3 months. Please plan to download it if you need it for a longer period of time.
